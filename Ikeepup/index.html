					9. Layout: In the desktop view (992px and above), each of the 3 sections should take up equal
					amount of space on the screen. As you make the browser window wider or narrower, each
					section should become wider or narrower. (Hint: use percentages to define width and use the
					'float' property. See Lecture 24). For a visual reference of this view, see the desktop mockup
					illustration below.<br>
